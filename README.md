# PCL
Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptation [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06021) (official Pytorch implementation). 
PCL is a simple yet powerful contrastive learning loss. PCL is a simple yet powerful contrastive learning loss. According to our understanding, PCL can be used in close-set learning tasks, that is, unlabeled data and labeled data belong to the same semantic space. We have verified 5 tasks so far, and we also expect researchers to verify the effectiveness of PCL in more tasks.
